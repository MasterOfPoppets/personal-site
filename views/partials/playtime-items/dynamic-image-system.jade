    p Lets take a look at the image below...
    img(src='images/playtime/IMG_1129.JPG')
    p
        | ...took a while to load didn't it!
    p
        | Thats because your browser had to make a request
        | to the server, which could be on the other side of the
        | world to get a copy of that image.
    p So what about this one...
    button(ng-click='test()') Click to load image
    .image-loader-720
        img(ng-src='{{testy.imgSrc}}')
    p
        | That should have been faster - but the images look 
        | the same size, so what is going on here?
    p   
        | The first image was the original image that I took
        | and uploaded to the server. It is in a massivley
        | high resolution - fantastic for viewing on the telly
        | or doing some really precise image manipulation, but
        | when we are displaying it on a computer monitor, or
        | even a mobile phone - it might be a bit excessive!
    p
        | The second image however, has been manipulated by the
        | server and reduced to a width of 720px - which just 
        | so happens to be the width of this page. Consequently
        | the file that is hauled back across the internet to
        | your browser is smaller in size, and therefore quicker
        | to load! All without reducing the quality of the image.
    p
        | The old fashioned way of doing this would to have been
        | to create many different images, one for each of the 
        | sizes that you might need, and upload them all to the 
        | server. The important thing to note about this approach
        | is that we have only uploaded one image to the server,
        | which could ultimately save you space and therefore money.
    p We are on a low resolution mobile screen?
    button(ng-click='test2()') Click to load image
    .image-loader-320
        img(ng-src='{{testy.imgSrc2}}')
    p No problem, we'll just load up an even smaller version!
